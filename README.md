# Complete Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality Development with Unity  
Unity is the leading platform to develop mixed reality experiences because it provides a great pipeline for working with 3D assets.  

Using a practical and project-based approach, this Learning Path educates you about the specifics of AR and VR development using Unity 2018 and Unity 3D. Youâ€™ll learn to integrate, animate, and overlay 3D objects on your camera feed, before moving on to implement sensor-based AR applications. Youâ€™ll explore various concepts by creating an AR application using Vuforia for both macOS and Windows for Android and iOS devices. Next, youâ€™ll learn how to develop VR applications that can be experienced with devices, such as Oculus and Vive. Youâ€™ll also explore various tools for VR development: gaze-based versus hand controller input, world space UI canvases, locomotion and teleportation, timeline animation, and multiplayer networking. Youâ€™ll learn the Unity 3D game engine via the interactive Unity Editor and C# programming.

THERE ARE MANY BENIFITS TO VR CONFERENCES  
PEOPLE CAN ATTEND REMOTELY FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD  
SAVING ATTENDESS TIME AND MONEY ON TRAVEL EXPENSES.  
VIRTUAL CONFERENCES ALLOW ATTENDEES AND THE REPRESSENTIVE TO INTERACT JUST LIKE IN REAL LIFE.  
SIMILARLY THEY CAN USE OUR VR RECORDING SYSTEM TO PLAY VIRTUAL SALES PITCHES .  
WE CAN ALSO USE TO PROMOTIONAL NEEDS TO RISE AN ORGANIZATION .  
NOTE:- EVERY OBJECT IS AN 3D OBJECT PRESENT HERE .  
IT ALSO SHOW VIRTUAL DEMONSTRATION OF ANY OBJECT IN ACTUAL SIZE .  
BREAKOUT .  
THE MEETING CAN BE AVAILABLE IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS .
